JGrep usage:    jgrep "foo.bar=1" foo.json
             or
                cat "foo.json" | jgrep "foo.bar=1"

Installation:

gem install jgrep

Flags:
    -s [document field] : Greps the json and only returns the value of the field specified
    -f                  : Display ugly json

Statements:
    A statement is defined as some value in a json document compared to another value.
    Available comparison operators are '=', '<', '>', '<=', '>='

    Example: foo.bar=1

Complex statements:

    Statements can be combined to form logical sentences. Order of precedence can be set with '(' and ')'
    Available logical operaters are 'and', 'or', '!'.

    Example: !(foo.bar=1) and (foo=bar)

In document comparison:

    If a document contains an array, the '[' and ']' operators can be used to define a comparison where
    statements are checked for truth on a per element basis.

    Example: [bar1=1 and bar2=2]

    on [{"foo":[{"bar1":1}, {"bar2":2}]},{"foo":[{"bar1":0}, {"bar2":0}]}]

    will return

    {foo:[bar1:1,bar2:2]}

Note: In document comparison cannot be nested.
